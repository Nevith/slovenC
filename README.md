# slovenC
### A general purpose programming language with slovenian syntax.
---
For my diploma at [FERI](https://feri.um.si/) [UM](https://www.um.si) i decided to try and create my own programming language. <br>
I set out to build a general purpose programming language and decided to make it with Slovene syntax as a gimmick.<br>
To force myself to learn modern C++ I decided to use C++17 standard and make my language `compilable` and `runnable` on `Windows and Linux`. <br>
I wanted to support `class inheritance` and implement some `predefined classes and functions`.
* Using: [antlr4](https://www.antlr.org/) for my lexet and parser. <br>
* Primarily using the [Visitor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Visitor_pattern) pattern.
* Might add more later...

For the sake of time and complexity I had to decide to abandon some features such as method overriding and specific super constructor calls, etc.
Missing features or limitations might get implemented later if I decide to continue working on this project after my diploma.
#### Planned features and limitations:
#### Features:
* Basic for loop
* Basic while loop
* If-else statements
* Exit statements (break, continue)
* Class Inheritance
* Predefined classes (generic list, string, double, boolean, int, void, object)
* A very basic IDE that will support syntax highlighting, project treeview, run button.
* A print function
* Might add more later...
#### Limitations:
* Unable to call specific super constructors
* Unable to override super methods (only hide them)
* Might add more later...
